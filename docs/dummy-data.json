One summer day in a city in the Japanese countryside…<br>\n<br>\nAt a shopping mall, he meets Smile, a beautiful girl in a mask. Cherry has trouble speaking in anything but haikus, and Smile wears a mask to hide her big, braces-covered front teeth. The two of them get closer as the south wind blows. One day, the two of them learn from Old Man Fujiyama, a master of Haiku who’s started going senile, that he’s searching for a certain record.<br>\n<br>\n“If I can hear this record again, I can remember… Something I don’t want to forget, but can’t remember…”<br>\n<br>\nCherry and Smile decide to help.
